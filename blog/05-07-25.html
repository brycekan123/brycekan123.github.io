              I’ve been and still am grappling with this concept. In my HS and undergrad, I felt extreme pressure (luckily not from parents) but from the school and surrounding peers to get the best grades no matter the cost (By no means, was I a 4.0 student).
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
              After re-entering school after working, I realized that it's totally fine to be average. To expand more, I don’t think this means that one should not set any goals and stay stagnant. Set your goals, strive to achieve them, but know that it's ok if you’re not the best or the top at it.

              And that as we get older, I think physical health, mental health, relationships, and just life in general take a higher priority than a grade or award. There are so many other factors like connections, likeability, etc. that play into getting that dream job or promotion than just grades and awards.

                However, I do understand the pressure of some students who don’t have the flexibility to just get above 3.0 (requirement for master’s programs). I’d just like to remind others, including myself, to <strong><u>smell the flowers</u></strong> and that the costs to be above average sometimes outweigh the benefits.
