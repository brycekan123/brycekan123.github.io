              I initially went to UW to pursue biology and do the premed track. Although I liked the theory and innovation behind biology, I quickly realized that I disliked the hospital aspect of doing pre-med. In my junior year, I volunteered at a local hospital by helping out nurses, wheeling patients in and out of rooms. While the tasks were necessary and fulfilling, I felt bored with these mundane tasks and often spent large chunks of time waiting to do something. I felt that a lot of the time, the staff were waiting to clock out or made it feel like a service-type role. This is where I realized that I wanted to work in a field where Iâ€™m building a project or working on a task over a long period to benefit others. I have the utmost respect for hospital workers and the medical field as my brief time there made me realize how difficult the work was.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
              Having 2 years of experience under my belt at the time and being a project-based field, I naturally transitioned to research. Research was actually where I felt I got the most value out of my time at UW as I learned hands-on skills, paper publication, and met top academics in the field. My work in the Bruchas lab was the core reason why I was able to land my first internship at Nanostring.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
              In industry, I was always the youngest person in the company, which made it hard to make friends, but there was a lot of wisdom passed down to me as everyone had years, even decades of experience. Working at Applied Materials and Bruker, I found working to be quiteâ€¦ easy actually. Oftentimes, I was able to relax throughout the workday. Stress level never got to a point that affected my mental or physical health, and I could always make time for friends. I would consider myself lucky as I had friends who worked significantly past 40 hours and were pushed to their limits.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
              While working in both companies, I realized that the career progression for Research Associates was limited, as higher positions required a PhD or to slowly (8+ years of experience) climb up to Scientist-level roles with promotions.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
              I also quickly became bored of the mundane tasks (I knowâ€¦ again..) as my primary tasks were to follow experimental procedures in a lab for 5+ hours a day and do repeated data analysis. This not only grew physically tiring but did not involve much critical thinking. I was to execute projects but rarely be the one who suggests the projects.

              I knew that CS was always something I wanted to explore. It had problem solving, a quick feedback loop of right or wrong, a lower academic ceiling, and was quite intriguing as it is essentially logic/problem solving. After taking on additional programming responsibilities, taking community college classes, and doing personal projects, I decided to apply for a Master's in CS to break into tech.

              I just completed my first year at USC and want to use NLP/LLMs and Computer Vision to solve difficult problems in areas like autonomous driving.
