          <h3 class="h3 section-title">📈  Growth Over the Past Year</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            Since coming to USC, it has been an incredible year of growth personally and professionally.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            Aspects of school that I appreciate: flexibility in dedicating your full attention into pursuing your passions. So far, I’ve spent the majority of Friday nights and weekends doing projects, assignments, and attending talks/seminars—but I don’t mind. This is a worthwhile sacrifice for the future and something I want to do.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            I still remind myself to take breaks and hang out with friends!

        <section class="industry-experience">
          <h3 class="h3 section-title">💻 Coding Journey</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            Looking back, I can finally say that I feel comfortable coding and able to identify high-level solutions to coding problems—something I wouldn’t have thought possible a year ago. Side note: I still struggle with bugs in my code.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            With GPT, minuscule errors are becoming less relevant, and more emphasis is placed on high-level thinking while AI handles the small stuff. This aligns with what our algorithms class (CSCI 570) teaches: focus on high-level approaches.

        <section class="usc-program">
          <h3 class="h3 section-title">🎓 USC’s MSCS Program</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            I don’t regret coming into this program one bit—in fact, I feel extremely lucky. It's filled with smart people from across the world. The cohort is roughly 80% international and 20% domestic, with many from top universities like IIT, NTU, UCSD, Berkeley, etc.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            Some might call it imposter syndrome, but honestly, I do feel behind the average in terms of grades and CS knowledge—I'm coming from an unrelated bachelor’s, so it’s an uphill battle.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            Class sizes vary: common classes like NLP, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Algorithms have 300+ students, while niche electives may have just 30.
          </p>

        <section class="scientist-track">
          <h3 class="h3 section-title">🛠️ Scientist and Engineer Track</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            I’m part of the Scientist and Engineers track, which is designed for those with an unrelated bachelor’s. It’s been a perfect fit. I continue to meet a diverse group with similar struggles—majors include Chemical Engineering, Math, Biomed, Aerospace, and more.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            I really appreciate this track. Transitioning from biotech to CS felt uncommon and isolating when I was working. Now, surrounded by driven individuals hustling to catch up, I feel inspired every day.

        <section class="social-support">
          <h3 class="h3 section-title">👥 Social Support at USC</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            Something that caught me by surprise is the level of social support USC provides. I’ve met countless people (undergrad and grad) through university-hosted events, seminars, socials, and talks. I didn’t have this in undergrad, and now it motivates me to make even more connections.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
            ✌️ Fight on?
